glsnake
-------

glsnake has been dubbed a "hardware accelerated executive stress toy" by its
fans.  It merely provides a virtual Rubiks' Snake toy for the user to play
with by rotating joints about; quite a lot of fun can be had by creating new
shapes with this toy.

Read the fine manual page for usage instructions.

If you've got this in a tarball, you should be able to do the standard old
./configure
make
make install
thing to get this up and running.

Notes for CVS:

If you have just checked this out of CVS, make sure you have the GNU autotools
installed and then run bootstrap in the top level directory.

The first time make is run, you will need a net connection to build the
ChangeLog and the supplementary model files -- distributed tarballs should
already come with these files; if not, please let us know.
