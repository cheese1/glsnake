glsnake
-------

glsnake has been dubbed a "hardware accelerated executive stress toy" by its
fans.  It merely provides a virtual Rubiks' Snake toy for the user to play
with by rotating joints about; quite a lot of fun can be had by creating new
shapes with this toy.

Read the fine manual page for usage instructions.

If you've got this in a tarball, you should be able to do the standard old
./configure
make
make install
thing to get this up and running.
