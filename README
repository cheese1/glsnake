-------

glsnake has been dubbed a "hardware accelerated executive stress toy" by its
fans.  It merely provides a virtual Rubiks' Snake toy for the user to play
with by rotating joints about; quite a lot of fun can be had by creating new
shapes with this toy.

Read the fine manual page for usage instructions.

If you've got this in a tarball, make sure you have SCons, and GLUT:

type

% scons

to get this up and running.

Patches to me, bug reports to /dev/null, and flames to the web forum of your
favourite distribution.
