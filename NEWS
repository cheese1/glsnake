NEWS for glsnake
----------------

Version 0.8.9:
* A lot of changes since the last version, including:
  - a rework of the code to merge the xscreensaver port back into the
    main trunk
  - fixed colour morph code
  - improved model morph code
  - THOUSANDS of new models
  - simple build system!
This same version (should) appear in xscreensaver 4.13.

Version 0.8.2:
After fixing up the manpage a bit more, Jaq has decided to make 'd' work as
expected.

Version 0.8.1:
glsnake is now usable outside of the source tree again, as it now hunts in a
few locations for its model data

Version 0.8:
Jamie has moved the entire source tree to the GNU autotools, which is great
news for all our users!
